This cheat sheet is mainly based on [@jsteinmann's cheat sheet](https://exams.vis.ethz.ch/user/jsteinmann/document/cheatsheet-analysis-ii-hs21) and [@huandri's cheat sheet](https://exams.vis.ethz.ch/user/huandri/document/analysis-i-cheat-sheet-fs21_0). Because of this reason this cheat sheet is also released under license CC BY-SA 4.0 and so must be all of its alterations.

Changes:
- Mostly changed formatting to improve readability.
- Also created vectorised versions of some of the graphics seen in the other cheat sheets.
- Added axioms seen in @huandri's cheat sheet.
- Strongly changed and added the definition in the "Potenzreihen" section.
- Added combined $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$ and $\tan(x)$ plot for convenience.
- Added derivatives encountered in exercises and exams.
- Generalised integrals using variables $a$, $b$ and $c$.
- Added some more complex trigonometry rules found in exercises.
- Many more small changes and probably some bigger ones I forgot to mention.

Hope you like it. Wish you all the best for the exam!
