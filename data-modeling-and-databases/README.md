This summary attempts to rewrite all exam-relevant definitions in a "more intuitive" way. These definitions are **not official definitions**, however I have found them to work consistently and in my opinion easier to understand and memorise. If any of them don't work, write a comment. 

**Remarks:**
- This document does not include SQL explanations. Instead, it focuses on other topics, as SQL is difficult to summarize concisely. I strongly recommend practicing SQL directly to improve query comprehension.
