### Introduction

This document is an updated and enhanced version of the cheatsheet originally created by [@dcamenisch](https://n.ethz.ch/~dcamenisch/uploads/DiskMat-Cheatsheet.pdf). It features revised lemma numbers, corrections of prior inaccuracies (though some new ones may have inadvertently been introduced), and several valuable additions.

**New Features (detailed on the last page):**  
- A table for multiplicative inverses.  
- Cardinalities of commonly used sets.  
- All groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ up to $(n = 30$, with generators highlighted in red.  
- The divisor function $\tau$ (also known as $\sigma_0$), particularly useful for determining the number of subgroups in $\mathbb{Z}_n$.  
- Additional insights and easter eggs for the curious reader.
